          <h4>
            Consider Both Your Current And Future Needs Before Purchasing Tech Tools
          </h4>

          <p>
            ne both your current and potential future needs before looking for new technology products.

          <h4>
             Know It’s Never Too Late To Learn To Code
          </h4>

          <p>
            My favorite tech tip is to never give up on coding. By committing to an “hour of code” each day and blocking that time in your calendar, you’ll continually develop problem-solving skills and enhance your productivity. Consistent practice will help you stay current with technology, make the most of your devices and tools and, ultimately, improve your relationship with tech. <small>
